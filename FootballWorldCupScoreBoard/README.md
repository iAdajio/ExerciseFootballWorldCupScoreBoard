// My process (for the code exercise review)
Step:
1. Create Test all methods for the score board operations outlined in Task document.
2. Run the test which should fail
3. Write some code to validate the operation and to pass the tests
4. Refactor the code and test
5. Add boundary tests for invalid inputs

// Acceptance Criteria
> Start a game and record the game match data to a collection containing active games.
> Finish a game and remove it from the game match data.
> Update a chosen game score with input scores (home,away)
> Output the summary of active games. Each game output format must be "{teamHome} - {teamAway}: {scoreHome} - {scoreAway}"
